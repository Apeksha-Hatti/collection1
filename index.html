<h3>History</h3>
<p>According to Hindu mythology, Kanchi silk weavers are the descendants of Sage Markanda, the master weaver of gods who is supposed to have woven tissue from lotus fibre. Also, while cotton is considered to be the favourite fabric of Lord Shiva, silk was preferred by Lord Vishnu.</p>
<h4>Weaving</h4>
<p>
The saris are woven from pure mulberry silk thread. The pure mulberry silk used in the making of Kanchipuram saris comes from South India and the zari comes from Gujarat. To weave a Kanchipuram sari three shuttles are used. While the weaver works on the right side, his aide works on the left side shuttle. The border colour and design are usually quite different from the body. If the pallu (the hanging end of the sari) has to be woven in a different shade, it is first separately woven and then delicately joined to the Sari. The part where the body meets the pallu is often denoted by a zigzag line. In a genuine Kanchipuram Silk Sari, body and border are woven separately and then interlocked together. The joint is woven so strongly that even if the saris tears, the border will not detach. That differentiates the kanchivaram silk saris from the others.</p>
<h4>Significance</h4>
<p>Kanchipuram saris woven with heavy silk and gold cloth are considered to be special and are worn on occasions and festivities.</p>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Apeksha S Hatti\Downloads\LBP2900_R150_V330_W64_uk_EN_2\banarasif.jpg"></center>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>describes Banaras as a thriving sector of the cotton textile industry. The earliest mention of the brocade and Zari textiles of Banaras is found in the 19th century. With the migration of silk weavers from Gujarat during the famine of 1603, it is likely that silk brocade weaving started in Banaras in the seventeenth century and developed in excellence during the 18th and 19th century. During the Mughal period, around 14th century, weaving of brocades with intricate designs using gold and silver threads became the specialty of Banaras.</p>

<p1>The traditional Banarasi saree is done with cottage industry for about 1.2 million people associated directly or indirectly with the hand loom silk industry of the region around Varanasi encompassing Gorakhpur, Chandauli, Bhadohi, Jaunpur and Azamgarh districts.</p1>

<p>Ramraj Cotton was founded at Avinashi, by entrepreneur and visionary, Mr. K.R.Nagarajan. The company was started with single, unwavering vision – to deliver quality men’s ethnic wear to people in the southern states.

Ramraj Cotton started out small in the year 1983. With very limited resources and very little financial leverage, Mr. K.R. Nagarajan founded the company on big dreams and huge aspirations.

With several years of marketing experience to back him, Mr. K.R. Nagarajan understood one simple success mantra – the power of branding. He understood that if his product has to stand out, people need to identify it by a brand name. That’s how the brand Ramraj was born. (Ramraj incidentally , is a combination of two names – Founder Mr. K. R. Nagarajan and his father Mr. Ramaswamy).

The company’s mantra of ‘quality without compromise’ was the driving force behind its astounding success, even during those early years. Slowly but surely, the company made definite inroads into the South Indian market.<br/><h3>Available other varieties.</h3></p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<h1><u>LINEN</u></h1>
<center><img src="C:\Users\Apeksha S Hatti\Downloads\LBP2900_R150_V330_W64_uk_EN_2\linen.jpg"</center>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word linen is of West Germanic origin and cognate to the Latin name for the flax plant, linum(linón).

This word history has given rise to a number of other terms in English, most notably line, from the use of a linen (flax) thread to determine a straight line. It is also etymologically related to a number of other terms, including lining, because linen was often used to create an inner layer for clothing, and lingerie, from French, which originally denoted underwear made of linen.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The discovery of dyed flax fibers in a cave in Georgia dated to 36,000 years ago suggests that ancient people used wild flax fibers to create linen-like fabrics from an early date
In ancient Mesopotamia, flax was domesticated and linen was first produced. It was used mainly by the wealthier class of the society, including priests. The Sumerian poem of the courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi (Tammuz), translated by Samuel Noah Kramer and Diane Wolkstein and published in 1983, mentions flax and linen. It opens with briefly listing the steps of preparing linen from flax, in a form of questions and answers between Inanna and her brother Utu.</p><br/>

<h1><u>KHADI</u></h1>
<img src="C:\Users\Apeksha S Hatti\Downloads\LBP2900_R150_V330_W64_uk_EN_2\khadi.jpg" width="400px" height="300px">
<p>Khadi is a hand-woven natural fiber cloth originating from eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent, mainly Eastern India, Northeastern India and Bangladesh, but are now broadly used in Pakistan and throughout India. This fabric is made mainly of cotton.

The cloth is usually woven from cotton and may also include silk or wool, which are all spun into yarn on a spinning wheel called a charkha. It is a versatile fabric, cool in summer and warm in winter. In order to improve the look, khaddar is sometimes starched to give it a stiffer feel. It is widely accepted in fashion circles.Khadi is being promoted in India by Khadi and Village Industries Commission, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In India, Khadi refers to handwoven and hand spun cloth. Weavers prefer the yarn produced by Mills because it is more robust and of consistent quality. Swadeshi movement of boycotting English products during the first two decades of the twentieth Century was popularised by Mahatma Gandhi and Indian mill owners, backed Nationalist politicians, who called for a boycott of foreign cloth. Gandhi argued that the mill owners would deny handloom weavers an opportunity to buy yarn because they would prefer to create a monopoly for their own cloth. However, handspun yarn was of poor quality and too costly. Thus Mahatma Gandhi started spinning himself and encouraging others to do so. He made it obligatory for all members of the Indian National Congress to spin cotton themselves and to pay their dues in yarn. He further made the chakri (spinning wheel) the symbol of the Nationalist movement. Initially the Indian flag was supposed to have a chakri, not the Ashoka Chakra at its centre. Mahatma Gandhi collected large sums of money to create a grass-roots organisation to encourage handloom weaving. This was called 'khaddar' or 'Khadi' movement.</p>
<h2><u>SILK SHIRTING</u></h2>
<img src="C:\Users\Apeksha S Hatti\Downloads\LBP2900_R150_V330_W64_uk_EN_2\silk shirts.jpg">
<p>Silk is a natural protein fiber, some forms of which can be woven into textiles. The protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons. The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture). The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors.

Silk is produced by several insects; but, generally, only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing. There has been some research into other types of silk, which differ at the molecular level. Silk is mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis, but some insects, such as webspinners and raspy crickets, produce silk throughout their lives. Silk production also occurs in hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants), silverfish, mayflies, thrips, leafhoppers, beetles, lacewings, fleas, flies, and midges. Other types of arthropods produce silk, most notably various arachnids, such as spiders.</p>

<p>A bed sheet is a rectangular piece of cloth used either singly or in a pair as bedding, being placed immediately below or above bed occupants. A top sheet, in the many countries where they are used, is a flat sheet, immediately under which bed occupants lie. A bottom sheet is laid above the mattress and bed occupants lie on it. A bottom sheet may be either a flat sheet, or a fitted sheet, which has been sewn to form a large pocket around the top, sides and bottom edge of a mattress, with elastic or a drawstring in the hem to stop it slipping off the bottom of the mattress. Blankets, quilts, duvets, comforters and other bed covers are laid over the top sheet.</p>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Apeksha S Hatti\Downloads\LBP2900_R150_V330_W64_uk_EN_2\towel.jpg"></center>
<p>

</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Middle Ages archaeological studies, "... closely held personal items included the ever present knife and a towel." However, the invention of the towel is commonly associated with the city of Bursa, Turkey, in the 17th century. These Turkish towels began as a flat, woven piece of cotton or linen called a pestamel, often hand-embroidered. Long enough to wrap around the body, pestamel were originally fairly narrow, but are now wider and commonly measure 90 by 170 centimetres (35 in × 67 in). Pestamel were used in Turkish baths as they stayed light when wet and were very absorbent.</p>
